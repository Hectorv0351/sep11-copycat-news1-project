Reflection:  
I did the News 1 website because it was the website with the hardest difficulty and why i chose this was because i wanted to see how well i could copy it and what i could learn while trying to copy it, and i did learn many things while making this project, one example could be the use of drop down boxes that i had to use in this project which i had trouble not knowing how it worked and only ideas, and i did like the outcome of the dropdown boxes.
